# Week 1 â€” App Containerization
pretty much I followed Andrews's week 1 journal : 
https://github.com/omenking/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-1/journal/week1.md

by adding the following lines to my docker composer file, I do not need to manually install npm i :
      
      # reason why I added the following line

Homework challenge: 
I worked on all he homework challenges and I encountered a few issues and learned new things from each tasks as follows:

- I had an issue with running the dockerfile CMD as an external script, I found out it was about the permission of the script on my local directory which I fixed the issue and it worked

- I created a docker hub account and pushed separate frontend and backend images to my repositories, but not sure if we can push both in the same images, not sure if this makes sense at all

- By applying multi-stage building for a Dockerfile build, I learned multi staging approach separates the build and runtime environments, allowing us to install the Python dependencies in a clean environment and avoid including unnecessary build tools in the final image. It also reduces the image size, as the builder stage is discarded after the dependencies are installed. 


how I used multisatging for backend and frontend dockers: 

Backend:

In this Dockerfile, the build stage is named "builder" and the runtime stage is named "runtime". In the build stage, we copy the requirements file, install the dependencies using pip, and copy the rest of the application code. We also set the PATH environment variable to include the user's local bin directory, so that any scripts installed using pip can be run from the command line.

In the runtime stage, we use a fresh Python image and copy only the necessary files from the builder stage, including the Python packages installed in the user's local directory. We also set the FLASK_ENV environment variable and expose the specified port. Finally, we copy the startup script and set it as the entrypoint.

This approach separates the build and runtime environments, allowing us to install the Python dependencies in a clean environment and avoid including unnecessary build tools in the final image. It also reduces the image size, as the builder stage is discarded after the dependencies are installed.

Frontend:

In this Dockerfile, the build stage is named "builder" and the runtime stage is named "runtime". In the build stage, we first copy the package.json and package-lock.json files and install the dependencies using npm install. We then copy the rest of the application code and build the production-ready assets using npm run build.

In the runtime stage, we use a fresh Node.js image and copy only the necessary files from the builder stage, including the built assets and the startup script. We also set the PORT environment variable and expose the specified port. Finally, we set the startup script as the entrypoint.

This approach separates the build and runtime environments, allowing us to install the dependencies and build the assets in a clean environment and avoid including unnecessary build tools in the final image. It also reduces the image size, as the builder stage is discarded after the assets are built. The use of the Alpine image for the runtime stage further reduces the image size by using a smaller base image.



My bakconed images changed from 129 M to 125 M 
And frontend docker changed from 1.19 g to 122M

- I added healthchek for both backend and frontend, and I realised the health check lines needs to be added to composer file.
